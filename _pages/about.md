About Me
======
I am a third year PhD student at the [Institute for Data Systems and Society (IDSS)](https://idss.mit.edu/academics/ses_doc/) at MIT, co-advised by [Marzyeh Ghassemi](https://healthyml.org/marzyeh/) and [Nikhil Agarwal](https://economics.mit.edu/people/faculty/nikhil-agarwal). Broadly, my research focuses on questions at the intersection of machine learning, healthcare, and inequity. My current work is driven by two goals: identifying racial and other disparities in healthcare using statistical and causal inference, and investigating novel ways to use machine learning to create more equitable systems. 

I interned at Microsoft Research New England in Summer 2022, hosted by [Allison Koenecke](https://koenecke.infosci.cornell.edu/) and [Lester Mackey](https://web.stanford.edu/~lmackey/). Prior to starting my PhD at MIT, I earned a Bachelor's in Applied Mathematics at Yale and a Master's in Data Science at Columbia. I also spent two years working in strategy consulting at [Altman Vilandrie & Company](https://www.altmansolon.com/).

Outside of work, I'm a huge sports fan, and spend a little too much time watching Liverpool FC and the Boston Celtics. I've also recently fallen in love with [curling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rsk30PQK8R0), the perfect way to get through the Boston winter.
