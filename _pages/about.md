About Me
======
I am a final year PhD student at the MIT [Institute for Data Systems and Society (IDSS)](https://idss.mit.edu/academics/ses_doc/), co-advised by [Marzyeh Ghassemi](https://healthyml.org/marzyeh/) and [Nikhil Agarwal](https://economics.mit.edu/people/faculty/nikhil-agarwal). Broadly, I am passionate about developing data-driven methods to improve health equity. My recent work primarily pursues this goal in the context of randomized experimentation, studying the design, execution, and analysis of clinical trials with heterogeneous populations. While my research has largely focused on healthcare, I am increasingly interested in digital experimentation and A/B testing for online platforms.

I interned at Amazon in Summer 2024, developing novel methods to detect heterogeneity in A/B tests for Amazon's internal experimentation platform (Weblab). I also previously interned at Microsoft Research New England (Summer 2022), hosted by [Allison Koenecke](https://koenecke.infosci.cornell.edu/) and [Lester Mackey](https://web.stanford.edu/~lmackey/). Prior to starting my PhD at MIT, I earned a Bachelor's in Applied Mathematics at Yale and a Master's in Data Science at Columbia. I also spent two years working in strategy consulting at [Altman Vilandrie & Company](https://www.altmansolon.com/).

Outside of work, I'm a huge sports fan, and spend a little too much time watching Liverpool FC and the Boston Celtics. I've also recently fallen in love with [curling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rsk30PQK8R0), the perfect way to get through the Boston winter.
